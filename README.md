DerSee is an android app built with Jetpack Compose that helps promote ocean sustainability. It utilizes autoML for object detection to identify trash in the ocean from images and video feeds.

## Key Features

- Splash screen and main app screen using Jetpack Compose UI  
- AutoML object detection to identify trash in oceans from images and videos
- TensorFLow Lite to enable the model to run even without internet connection
- Information cards about ocean sustainability for users to learn more
- Secure user authentication and data storage

## Object Detection Model

The app uses an autoML object detection model trained to identify different types of trash found in the oceans like plastic bottles, bags, debris etc. The model can detect trash in static images as well as live video streams.

Transfer learning with a pre-trained model and custom training data is used to train a robust trash classification model.

## Sustainability Information

The app includes a scrollable row of information cards that provide more context about ocean sustainability to users. This covers topics like:

- The impact of pollution on ocean life   
- Sustainable fishing practices
- Reducing plastic use and recycling properly
- Supporting organizations that promote ocean health

## Security

User authentication is implemented so users can securely access their account and data. Cryptographic storage keeps uploads safe and tamper-proof.

## app Stack

- Kotlin
- JetPack Compose 
- Navigation
- TensorFlow Lite for ML model
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Cloud Storage

The app is built using a fully Kotlin stack leveraging Android Jetpack libraries like Compose for UI and Navigation plus Firebase for backend functionality.

##How to Use
Download the app and start playing with it. Nerds should just clone the app and run it on their emulators/devices to test the performance

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or PRs for any enhancements or additions you would like to see made to the ocean sustainability information or object detection model.
